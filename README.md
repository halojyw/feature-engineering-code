In this study, we use 60-second biological sensor records from hundreds of participants to classify their activity states. We explore different features ranging from basic statistical metrics to advanced measures, such as Fourier Transform and Signal Magnitude Area. Our baseline approach uses Logistic Regression, but we further extend our analysis by incorporating the Random Forest model. This shift recognises the limitations of Logistic Regression’s linear decision boundaries when dealing with high-dimensional sensor data.
Our methodology begins with data pre-processing and proceeds to test various types of feature mapping, analysing the improvements on the model through the comparison of AUC values.
